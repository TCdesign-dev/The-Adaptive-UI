# The Dynamic UI

## So...what is

The performance of a website depends on several factors, including the speed of animations. Our system focuses on optimising animations, adapting them to the speed of user navigation and interaction. This allows us to meet the needs of a wide range of users, which vary according to browsing habits and specific situations.
For example, some users prefer to navigate quickly, requiring fast and responsive animations, while others, who may use the computer less frequently, may have no particular needs or prefer slower but clean animations. In addition, the speed of animations may be influenced by the situation the user is in, such as whether or not he or she is in a hurry, thus influencing the specific requirements regarding the speed of the page used.
In this context, our `Dynamic UI` system aims to provide an optimised browsing experience for the individual needs of each user by adapting the speed of the animations according to the time taken to interact with the site.
